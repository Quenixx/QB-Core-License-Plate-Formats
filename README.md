So basically, I’ve been searching for a long time about how to change the formats on license plates in qb, as I’ve been developing a Scandinavian server, I wanted the format “ABC 123” instead of GTAs random license plate formats, I’ve decided to share this with me which basically is a easy fix, but for those who don’t know and looking for it.
